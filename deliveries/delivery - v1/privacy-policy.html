              specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may

              information about how and when you use our Services, and other

            </p>

            <p>
              Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies
              and similar technologies.
            </p>

            <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,
                diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers
                automatically collect when you access or use our Services and
                which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with
                us, this log data may include your IP address, device
                information, browser type, and settings and information about
                your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps
                associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches,
                and other actions you take such as which features you use),
                device event information (such as system activity, error reports

                your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access
                the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may
                include information such as your IP address (or proxy server),
                device and application identification numbers, location, browser
                type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile
                carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Location Data. We collect location data such as information
                about your device’s location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type
                and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For
                example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
                your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this
                information either by refusing access to the information or by
                disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you
                choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of
                the Services.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
              this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
              implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
              currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
              that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
              online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
              follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
              revised version of this privacy notice.

                  <p>If this definition of “resident” applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.</p>

<p>Your rights with respect to your personal data</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete</p>

<p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>

<ul>
    <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>

<p style="text-decoration: underline">Verification process</p>

<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
